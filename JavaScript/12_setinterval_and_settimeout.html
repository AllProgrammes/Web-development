  <title>This is me learning how to perform a event after a set time interval</title>
</head>

<body>
  <div class="box">This is me becoming obsolete day by day</div>
  <script>
    function greet() { // creating a function for greeting 
      let name = prompt("Please enter your name : ", ""); //declaring a variable which takes input
      alert(name + " You are gay !!\nNo Joke You are :)");
    }
    //setTimeout(greet, 2000); // setting timer which is 2000ms
    let Timeout = setTimeout(greet, 5000);//this will give a unique ID that we can use to clear as shown as line number 21 below
    console.log(Timeout);//prints that unique ID in the console
    clearTimeout(Timeout);//clears the event before whenever triggered --> which in this case is instant

    // so now that we will see how to trigger that event repeatedly 
    setInterval(greet, 10000);
    // same we can get an ID from it and we can delete it  like we did in the case of setTimeout
    //let interval= setInterval(greet, 10000);
    //clearInterval(interval);
