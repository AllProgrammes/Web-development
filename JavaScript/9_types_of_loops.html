    // Types of loop

    // 1. For loop
    for (let number = 0; number <= 3; number++) {
      //This loop will start from 0 and go to 3 so we will get 4 times execution
      console.log(`I have started myself at 0 and This time I have become ${number}`);
    }

    // idk what I am showing this but you can print an array using for loop
    //so lets take a array
    let name = ["B", "i", "s", "w", "a", "j", "i", "t"];
    for (let index = 0; index < name.length; index++) {
      console.log(`${name[index]} is ${index + 1} letter of my name and I am printing this using simple/traditional FOR loop`);
    }

    // 2. FOR EACH loop
    // so what i have shown u above can be done with a lot more hassle and less codes using this modern javascript technique
    name.forEach(element => { //or name.forEach(function f(element){ 
      console.log("I am printing this using FOR-EACH loop " + element);
    });

    // 3. FOR OF loop
    for (element of name) {
      console.log("I am printing this using FOR-OF loop " + element);
    }

    // 4. FOR IN loop - can be used to iterate over objects in javascript
    let student_info = {
      Name: "Biswajit",
      Course: "BCA",
      Fee: 55000
    }
    for (key in student_info) {
      console.log(`${key} is ${student_info[key]}`);
    }

    // 5.WHILE loop - huff finally
    let lucky_number = 11;
    while (lucky_number > 0) {
      console.log(`I wil keep runnnig untill ${lucky_number} is greater than 0.`);
      lucky_number--;// u can see this as ->   lucky_number = lucky_number - 1  after each loop count
    }

    // 6. DO WHILE loop - runs at least once irrespective of the condition 
    let madboy = 3;
    do {
      console.log("I am madboy !! count -> " + madboy);
      madboy--;
    } while (madboy > 0);
